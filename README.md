- 👋 Hi, I’m @airborne-surge
- I am currently working on refining past projects before posting them here. 👷‍♂️ 🚧
- I love to read and learn new things regarding Computer Science and then put that knowledge into practice. 📚
- As such, you are more likely to see projects from newer topics I have been studying as the more recent repositories.

<!---
